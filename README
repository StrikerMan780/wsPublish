About wsPublish
---------------
wsPublish was original developed as the Steam Workshop publishing tool for
Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition and Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. The project was
commissioned by General Arcade and developed by Ethan Lee.

Included is a command-line tool called cmdtool, which is a basic example of how
wsPublish can be used to quickly manage Workshop projects. As long as your
steam_appid.txt is in the same folder as the cmdtool executable, it should be
usable with your game immediately (albeit with a slight catch related to tags,
search main.c for a couple TODO lines about that).

The main intention is to allow users to integrate wsPublish into their own tools
to allow for built-in Workshop support, without the need for an additional
program to manage their uploads.

Dependencies
------------
Other than the Steamworks SDK, wsPublish depends on the C++ runtime and cmdtool
depends on the C runtime. It may be possible to fix the dependency on C++ by
making use of the C API now included in modern Steamworks SDK releases.

Building wsPublish
------------------
Before doing anything else, extract your Steamworks SDK's "sdk" folder to the
root of this repository. Then, to generate the build files, use CMake.

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..

*nix platforms and MinGW users will be able to simply type `make` after this,
while Windows users will likely want to add a flag to the `cmake` line to
generate a Visual Studio project (see the CMake documentation for details).
